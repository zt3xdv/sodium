            Thank you for submitting your **egg request**! 🥚
          
            Your suggestion helps us identify eggs that the community would like to see supported in the repository.
          
            Please keep in mind:
            - Egg requests are fulfilled by **volunteer staff and community members**.
            - There is **no guaranteed timeline** for development or publication.
            - We **cannot guarantee** that an egg for this would be created.
          
            If you’re interested in contributing, you’re always welcome to help develop an egg for this request or collaborate with others who may wish to work on it.
